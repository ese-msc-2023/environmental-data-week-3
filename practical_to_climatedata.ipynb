    "See the installation instructions [here](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/quickstart/installation.html). Note that based on experience with previous classes, ESMValTool may or may not install for you. ESMValTool can be helpful, but it is not required. Give it a try, but if it doesn't work for you, don't spend too much of your time on this. \n",

    "     The netCDF library (installed in the esmvaltool enviroment, or via homebrew, conda, or some other means) has a very useful command, called `ncdump`. This command literally 'dumps' the data from a file to wherever. While this could be useful, I find 'ncdump' most useful when use as `ncdump -h <filename.nc>`, where the `-h` option stands for 'header'. This will print the headers of the netCDF file to screen. It is extremely useful to know what are in the netCDF files without having to open them. \n",
